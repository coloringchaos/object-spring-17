You are expected to keep an online journal of your progress throughout this class.  Your instructor will read this journal to see how you’re are progressing, so you should update your journal regularly over the course of the semester. At a minimum, you are expected to create a post for each Lab and Project. You are also exptected to summarize any insights you have in each week’s work, to discuss to the readings, and to document your production projects and technical research thoroughly.

#### What's the point?

... 

**Your blog is not a portfolio!** It is distinctly different...

#### Good documentation habits

You may document your major projects in a separate individual or group site if you choose, but you will be expected to link your site to the your class page on this site. Please avoid formats that are not text-searchable, as they won’t show up on search engines for others to use.

Blogs are great for documenting your process, as they’re usually organized in reverse chronological order. Once you’ve finished a project, however, set up a separate page or pages to summarize your projects when they’re done, so you can use this as a link in your portfolio.

***Document your projects thoroughly as you go; don’t put it off until the end.***

Good documentation should include a description and illustration of your project. You should include what it looks like, what it does, what the user or participant does in response. When it’s interactive, mention and show what the user does. Your explanation should give enough information that someone who’s never seen the project can  understand it.

You should also include a section describing how the project works, aimed at a more informed reader (your instructor, or next year’s classmates). Include a system diagram to make clear what the major components of the system are and how they communicate.

Use pictures, drawings, and videos liberally to explain your work.

Make sure any code you post is well-commented, so you and others can understand what it does. ***Don’t overload your notes with code.*** Code repositories like gitHub are best for sharing code, rather than blogs, so ***post your code to a repository and link to it from your blog***.


#### Cite your sources

Make sure to cite sources from which you get your ideas, code, circuits, and construction techniques. When you base your work on someone else’s, cite the original author and link to their work, just as you would when quoting another author in a paper. If you only changed one part of an existing program, post only the part you changed, and link to the original. Copying code or techniques without attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you learned and by which you were were inspired. So be generous in sharing your sources.


#### Some good project summary sites:

+ [http://www.tweenbots.com/](http://www.tweenbots.com/) by Kacie Kinzer
+ [http://tomgerhardt.com/fireLight/](http://tomgerhardt.com/fireLight/) By Tom Gerhardt. Simple project, doesn’t need a lot to introduce it.
+ [http://thomas-gerhardt.com/itp/FeltResistor/](http://thomas-gerhardt.com/itp/FeltResistor/) Nice explanation of why, and summary of how it works, in a sentence or two.
+ Nice project materials in [FRSK04](http://frsk04.com/) by Sam Lavigne and Fletcher Bach
+ Sleek and professional one page website by Rucha and Alina
+ Simple and effective project documentation by David Tracy


#### A few good recent sample journals:

+ Well documented Labs and especially when taken to the next step by Ma Tan.
+ Good sketching of interface and bill of materials by Ben Gullard
+ Useful example of a technical System Diagram to show how many Arduino pins are needed for the project by Kyle Greenberg and Seiya Kobayashi
+ Bona Kim’s final project is explained well
+ Matt Richardson’s blog documents the weekly labs well and he wrote up his final project nicely as well.
+ Nicely detailed blog throughout the semester from Roopa Vasudevan
+ Another detailed narrative from Justin Lange
+ Good narrative blog from Owen Roberts
+ Useful questions at the end of each blog post, for next class:
+ Nice example of the first Arduino lab turned into a game by Mimi Onouoha
+ Moustache switch by Tak Cheung, nicely documented in video.
+ Morgen Fleisig’s intro to physical computing blog
+ Jason Babcock’s journal These are notes Jason kept throughout his time at ITP. Each section covers the technical details of a specific project. Sometimes the task is part of a larger project, and sometimes it’s a project in itself. This is an excellent example of how to document the tech details of your projects.
