Build a circuit using a breadboard that lights an LED. Create a creative enclosure for your hardware.

**Tasks:**

1. Create blog and email me the link
2. Light an LED (or a few!) using a battery on a breadboard
3. Build a creative enclosure for your LED circuit
4. Document what you made
4. Post a response to your blog *(see below)*

**Lab 1 Resources:**

+ Sparkfun's [how to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard) and ITP's [setting up a breadboard](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-electronics/breadboard/)
+ [ITP's Electronics Lab](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-electronics/electronics/) - scroll down to the 'basic LED circuit' section
+ [LED Current](https://vimeo.com/album/2801639/video/78674965)

**Blog Response:** 

+ Post photos of what you made for lab 1 and write a short description of what you built
+ How would you define physical interaction? What makes a good physical interaction? Are there works from others that you would say are good examples of digital technology that are not interactive? Consider Bret Victor's Brief Rant. 
+ What are your goals for this class?


**Lab 1 is due...** Submit a link to your blog post on Edmodo.
